## Overview

Dulce Base is an alleged secret underground facility located beneath Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. According to conspiracy theories originating in the 1980s, the base is a joint operation between the US government and extraterrestrial beings, conducting horrific experiments on humans and animals in a seven-level underground complex.

The claims primarily stem from Paul Bennewitz's UFO investigations in the late 1970s and Phil Schneider's sensational testimony in the 1990s. Despite extensive investigation by UFO researchers and journalists, **no physical evidence, photographs, or credible documentation has ever been found** to support the existence of this facility.

### Alleged Activities

The conspiracy theories claim:

- **Human experimentation** — Kidnapped humans subjected to experiments

|------|-------|--------------|
| 1979 | Paul Bennewitz begins investigations | Observes lights near Kirtland AFB, develops Dulce theories |
| 1980 | Cattle mutilations in area | Mysterious animal deaths fuel speculation |
| 1982 | Alleged firefight | Schneider later claims 1979 alien encounter |
| 1988 | Bennewitz hospitalized | Psychological breakdown, possibly from stress or manipulation |
| 1995 | Phil Schneider lectures | Public testimony about base and aliens |
| 1996 | Schneider dies | Ruled suicide, conspiracy theorists suspicious |

## The Schneider Story

### Phil Schneider's Claims

In 1995 lectures, Schneider claimed:

1. **Background**: Geologist and engineer for government projects
2. **1979 Incident**: Drilling at Dulce, encountered Grey aliens
3. **Firefight**: Military and aliens exchanged fire, 60+ casualties
4. **Injury**: Lost fingers in the encounter (showed scarred hand)
5. **Cover-up**: Government suppressed the incident

### Problems with Schneider's Account

- ❌ No employment records verified
- ❌ No witnesses to corroborate story
- ❌ Medical experts disputed injury explanation
- ❌ Story changed in different tellings
- ❌ No documentation provided
- ❌ Many factual errors about geology and engineering

### Schneider's Death

- **Date**: January 1996
- **Official ruling**: Suicide by strangulation
- **Conspiracy claim**: Murdered to silence him
- **Evidence**: Death consistent with suicide, no evidence of foul play

## Location: Dulce, New Mexico

### The Town

- **Population**: ~2,600
- **Location**: Jicarilla Apache Nation land
- **Economy**: Small rural town, ranching
- **Awareness**: Local residents largely unaware of base theories

### Archuleta Mesa

- **Terrain**: High desert mesa country
- **Accessibility**: Remote but not inaccessible
- **Surveys**: No geological evidence of underground construction
- **Satellite imagery**: No surface indications of facility

## Evidence Analysis

### Claimed Evidence

| Type | Source | Credibility |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Testimony | Phil Schneider | Very low - unverified, inconsistent |
| Testimony | Thomas Castello | Very low - identity never verified |
| Documents | Anonymous leaks | Very low - easily fabricated, no verification |
| Photos | "Castello papers" | Very low - likely fake |
| Observations | Paul Bennewitz | Low - possibly influenced by disinformation |

### Why No Evidence Exists

If Dulce Base were real, we would expect:

✅ Surface construction evidence (ventilation, access, utilities)  
✅ Geological disturbances from tunneling  
✅ Increased traffic and security visible to locals  
✅ Employment records and paper trails  
✅ Whistleblower documents with verification  
✅ Satellite imagery anomalies  

**Reality**: None of these exist.

## Theories & Explanations

### Conspiracy Theory: Real Underground Base

**Claim**: Dulce Base exists, government covers it up  
**Proponents**: UFO conspiracy theorists  
**Evidence**: Only uncorroborated testimony  
**Assessment**: No credible evidence supports this

### Disinformation Campaign

**Claim**: Story created to discredit UFO research or hide real classified activities  
**Proponents**: Some UFO researchers  
**Evidence**: Documented Air Force interest in Bennewitz, psychological manipulation  
**Assessment**: Most plausible explanation for Bennewitz's involvement

### Complete Fabrication

**Claim**: Entire story is fiction, no basis in reality  
**Proponents**: Mainstream skeptics  
**Evidence**: Complete lack of any verifiable evidence  
**Assessment**: Most likely for Schneider/Castello claims

### Mental Illness & Delusion

**Claim**: Bennewitz suffered delusions, Schneider fabricated for attention  
**Evidence**: Bennewitz's hospitalization, lack of corroboration  
**Assessment**: Possible contributing factor

## The Paul Bennewitz Disinformation Campaign

### What Likely Happened

According to Greg Bishop's book *Project Beta* (2005):

1. **1979**: Bennewitz observes lights near Kirtland AFB (real classified tests)
2. **AFOSI Interest**: Air Force Office of Special Investigations takes interest
3. **Disinformation**: Fed Bennewitz false information to discredit him
4. **Escalation**: Bennewitz develops increasingly elaborate theories
5. **Breakdown**: Psychological stress leads to 1988 hospitalization
6. **Legacy**: Dulce Base myth continues beyond original disinformation

### Why Disinformation?

- Hide real classified projects at Kirtland AFB
- Discredit Bennewitz as UFO researcher
- Create confusion in UFO research community

---

## Cattle Mutilations Connection

### The Link

- 1970s-1980s: Mysterious cattle deaths in New Mexico
- Investigator Gabe Valdez (State Police) documented cases
- Bennewitz connected mutilations to alleged Dulce aliens
- **Reality**: Mutilations likely from natural predation misinterpreted

---

## Cultural Impact

### In UFO Conspiracy Culture

- Major fixture of underground base theories
- Spawned numerous books, videos, documentaries
- Influenced other conspiracy theories
- Example of how unverified claims spread

### Popular Culture

- Referenced in conspiracy-themed media
- Influenced sci-fi underground base tropes
- Subject of numerous YouTube investigations

---

## Current Status

**Evidence Level**: None  
**Researcher Consensus**: Unfounded  
**Public Interest**: Continues in conspiracy circles  
**Mainstream View**: Debunked urban legend  

### Why the Story Persists

- Compelling narrative (government-alien conspiracy)
- Lack of evidence treated as "proof of cover-up"
- Confirmation bias in believer communities
- Internet amplification of unverified claims
