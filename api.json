      "full": "Dulce Base is an alleged secret underground facility located beneath Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. According to conspiracy theories originating in the 1980s, the base is a joint operation between the US government and extraterrestrial beings, conducting horrific experiments on humans and animals in a seven-level underground complex. The claims primarily stem from Paul Bennewitz's UFO investigations in the late 1970s and Phil Schneider's sensational testimony in the 1990s. Despite extensive investigation by UFO researchers and journalists, no physical evidence, photographs, or credible documentation has ever been found to support the existence of this facility."
